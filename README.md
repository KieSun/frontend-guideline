The following document describes generic rules of writing in development languages that we use on our Front-end projects, that HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React and Vue

The idea of this repository is not to be a complete guideline, the target is just help developers who participate in our projects to be able to inform the coding standards used.

As this is a live document, some rules may not have been applied in old projects and changes can occur at any time.
